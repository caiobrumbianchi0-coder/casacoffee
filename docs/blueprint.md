## Core Features:

- Recipe Catalog: Display recipes organized into modules (categories) in a Netflix-style horizontal grid layout. Each recipe appears as a card with an image and name.
- Recipe Detail Page: Display complete recipe details including name, ingredients with quantities, preparation steps, preparation time, serving size, and optional extra tip.
- Module-Based Filtering: Filter the recipe catalog by selecting a specific module (e.g., Classic Coffees, Iced Coffees, etc.) to narrow down the recipe list.
- Recipe Search: Enable users to search for recipes by name.
- Favorites List: Allow users to save the recipes into a personalized 'My Favorite Recipes' section. Allow toggling of the saved state.
- AI Recipe Tool Tip Generator: Utilize AI to generate relevant and helpful tips for each recipe, adding extra information for the user based on ingredients and cooking method. The AI is a tool that is reasoned about and called by the application, rather than invoked implicitly.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Rich coffee bean brown (#6F4E37) to evoke a sense of warmth and the essence of coffee.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), providing a neutral and appetizing backdrop that makes recipe cards stand out.
- Accent color: Burnt orange (#CC6633) for interactive elements like buttons and highlights, complementing the brown tones.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif font for headings.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a versatile sans-serif font that ensures easy readability and a contemporary feel for descriptions and instructions.
- Use a set of minimalist icons that visually represent each recipe category and enhance the user interface without overwhelming it. Example: A steaming cup of coffee for 'Classic Coffees'.
- Design the layout to be mobile-first, ensuring a fluid and responsive experience on devices of various sizes. Recipe cards will adjust and adapt for optimal display.
